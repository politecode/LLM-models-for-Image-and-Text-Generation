#### ML Model Deployment with Replicate


This project utilizes the "replicate" library to interact with machine learning models hosted on the Replicate platform. The code installs the library, sets up the Replicate API token, and demonstrates the execution of two models: "stability-ai/stable-diffusion" and 'a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat'. The models are prompted with specific inputs, and the generated outputs are printed.
